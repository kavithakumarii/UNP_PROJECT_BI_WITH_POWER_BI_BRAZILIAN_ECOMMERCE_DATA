# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILIAN_ECOMMERCE_DATA
In collaboration with UNP, I developed the Brazilian Ecommerce Dashboard to provide key insights into customer distribution and performance metrics. The dashboard analyzes customer demographics, sales trends, product performance, order fulfillment, delivery efficiency, customer satisfaction, and payment preferences. It highlights strengths in sales, customer engagement, and delivery operations while identifying areas for improvement. Key opportunities for growth include expanding payment options, optimizing product selection, and revitalizing sales through targeted marketing and enhanced customer engagement. This data-driven approach supports informed content recommendations and strategic business decisions in the ecommerce sector.
